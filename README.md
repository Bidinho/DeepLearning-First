# Deep Learning - Linear Regression, Perceptron and MLP

## Description
This mini-project was developed as the first homework for Deep Learning class.

ames.npz
- The ames housing prices dataset, used in regression.py

download_fashion_mnist.py
- allows you to download the Fashion-MNIST dataset to a compressed .npz file,
  which img_class_lin_class_nn.py and img_class_autodiff.py can load.

regression.py
- Covers regression

img_class_lin_class_nn.py
- Covers classification with
  the perception, logistic regression, and the multi-layer perceptron, with
  implementation in numpy.

img_class_autodiff.py
- Covers classification with
  logistic regression and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in
  torch.

## Installation:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 download_fashion_mnist.py
```
